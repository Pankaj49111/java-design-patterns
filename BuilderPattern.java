/**
What is the Builder Pattern?
The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct a complex object step by step. 
It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations (or configurations) of an object.
The Builder Pattern is particularly useful when you need to create an object that has many parts or fields and you want to control the construction process in a step-by-step manner, ensuring that you donâ€™t end up with an incomplete or inconsistent object.

When to Use the Builder Pattern?
When an object has many parameters or configurations that need to be set.
When you want to create objects that must follow a particular construction sequence or must be built in stages.
When the object you're building is complex and you want to avoid having a constructor with too many parameters (known as the telescoping constructor problem).
